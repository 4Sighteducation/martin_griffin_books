  "description1": "Five hundred kilometres out in the Atlantic Ocean lies an island. The last in its tiny archipelago, Navigaceo contains only empty caves, an abandoned lighthouse and a colony of seals. The last time anyone set foot there was 1971.\n\nUntil now. A team of research scientists, accompanied by Quin Macfarlane, a documentary filmmaker, are the first in recent memory to explore the island's tangled forests.",
  "description2": "But on arrival, Quin makes a devastating discovery; while filming, she spots a body in a cove at the foot of the treacherous cliffs. And although nobody has been on Navigaceo for half a century, the corpse has all the markers of a recent death . . .",
  "description3": "Each member of the research team has secrets. More than one of them could be a murderer. It's five days until they will be returned to the mainland. And Quin knows if she's not careful, there could be another body on the shore by morning.",
